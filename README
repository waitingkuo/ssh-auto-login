A python script used to automatically generate RSA pri/pub key pair and install in the remote computer.

Usage:

We want to login 192.168.100.1 as willy

xxx.xxx$ python ssh_auto_login.py
Remote user: willy
Remote host: 192.168.100.1
And then enter your password twice, that's all.

Next time when you have a ssh to this remote host as user willy, you should never the password.
